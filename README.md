# Overview
A set of simple python scripts related to maths and physics (mostly SciComm). These are posted on Twitter at [@RMathsPhys](https://twitter.com/RMathsphys/). The idea is to build each one _"from scratch"_.

### Some Animations
These rely heavily (if not entirely) on the fantastic `matplotlib` package.
